    <h2>Computer Hardware and Software</h2>

    <p>I am currently working in a helpdesk role in the corporate office of an oil company. Professionally, I would like to develop enough in the company to allow me to build myself a career that will provide me with the income I will need to get my homestead prepared and operational for retirement. To date I have not decided on a specialization, as I enjoy a little of everything computer related and am not particularly passionate about any one part. My goal is to learn about everything that is needed to eventually allow me to work in computer repair and support as a small business locally in Big Spring. This would not be full time, but instead would be a supplement to my homestead during retirement. </p>
    
    <p> I have developed a proficiency for the hardware repair portion of my career as well as a proficiency for troubleshooting Windows and most software. I am still eager to gain more knowledge about the development and utilization of aspects, such as, web design and multiple applications for computer use. I believe eventually I will need to also study aspects of business and bookkeeping. I find myself not as excited about those aspects of my goals. </p>
